# KRB's Clock
For a few months, I have been working on my full-stack web dev skills. This includes the three from MEAN web package i.e Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. To take a break I decided to build a mini project for my front end web application portfolio. 
I always wanted to build an alarm that could actually help in waking up the user rather than just ringing with no purpose! (I won't reveal everything here, give it a try!) And so I designed the mentioned project. I tried to collaborate the idea with an attractive Analog Clock (brushed my UI skills!) and a Stopwatch. However, I feel I need to work on its scalability and launch it as an app(which I will surely do after picking app development exposure). 
Always open to suggestions and guidance. Thanks anyway!
